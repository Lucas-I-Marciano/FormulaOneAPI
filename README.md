- Libraries and Framework<br>
  Both are external resourcer to help me build my application<br>
  Funcionalities: Library Provide and Framework beside provide, it guide you<br>
  Code: We use library as an addition to our code | Framework provide a code and we will adapt to its code (<b>Inversion of control</b>)
  On this project I will use <i><b><a href="https://expressjs.com/">ExpressJS</a></b></i><br>

- Cache<br>
  It is a memory like the RAM but much more quick, with much less amount available compared with RAM. Processing will use data from RAM, but if it would need more times, it will store on CACHE after the first consult with RAM<br>

- REST Protocol<br>
  Stand for "Representation State Transfer". It is a collection of rules to make our web communication has "Organization", "Flexibility", "Efficiency", Stability"<br>
  <b>Stateless</b>: All requisition should have all information needed for your request<br>
  <b>Layer and Uniform</b>: Develop our information in an hierarchy way || Padronize our HTTP Method (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) - something like "CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete" || Padronize our response based on this <i><b><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status">LIST</a></b></i><br>

- Our Standarization<br>
I will divide my API in two main paths as intuitive as possible
<ul>
<li>Driver: Returning the list of drivers</li>
<li>Constructors: Returning the list of Constructors</li>
</ul><br>

- Starting our project<br>
  I will use "data.js" as a database in order to focus on how to build an API<br>

- Order's algorithms<br>
